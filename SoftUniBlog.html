                            Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father,
                            the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African
                            nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful
                            old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn
                            into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced
                            with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power
                            of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of
                            life. “Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai
                            Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, with Angela Bassett,
                            with Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. The film is directed by Ryan Coogler and produced by
                            Kevin Feige with Louis D’Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Nate Moore, Jeffrey Chernov and Stan Lee
                            serving as executive producers. Ryan Coogler & Joe Robert Cole wrote the screenplay. Marvel
                            Studios’ “Black Panther” hits theatres on February 16, 2018.

                            Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the
                            same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion
                            Pictures, it is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is
                            directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, and stars
                            Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o,
                            Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett,
                            Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa returns home as king of Wakanda
                            but finds his sovereignty challenged by a new adversary, in a conflict with global
                            consequences.

                            Wesley Snipes expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project
                            did not come to fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film
                            as one of ten based on Marvel characters and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey
                            was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black Panther was announced in October 2014,
                            and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016).
                            By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making Black Panther
                            the first Marvel film with a predominantly black cast. Principal photography took place from
                            January to April 2017, at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area,
                            and Busan, South Korea.

                            Black Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in
                            the United States on February 16, 2018, in 2D, 3D, IMAX and other premium large formats.
                            The film received praise for its screenplay, direction, performances, action, costume
                            design, production merits, and soundtrack, though the CGI effects received some criticism.
                            Critics considered it as one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural
                            significance. It has grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing
                            film of 2018, as well as the seventh highest-grossing film ever in the United States and
                            16th highest-grossing film of all time. Its four-day opening weekend gross of $242.1
                            million and its three-day gross of $202 million in the United States were the second
                            and fifth highest of all time, respectively, as well as the biggest debut by an
                            African-American director.
